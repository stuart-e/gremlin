Gremlin take home interview project

After two hours this is the extent of the Quotely project that I reached.
The main method is inside src\com\quotely\qoutely.java and takes a single input (ENGLISH or RUSSIAN)

Next steps would be to create unit tests which test the functionality with different input.
Things to check for:
- Valid input
- Invalid input
- Failure messages

Other optimizations and improvements that could be added:
- Retry strategy to the external API call
- Break down the API URL into the different components allowing for more input options
- More input options to the main call to allow different results to be displayed to the user
- Add an option to provide the quote number to re-retrieve a quote.
